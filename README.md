## 👋 Hello! I'm Kolin63
Also known as Colin. I love to code, and hope to do a lot of it before AI takes over. 

## 📊 Skills
At the time of writing this, I have base 40 melee stats and I've been having a lot of fun training crafting. That was a joke. Haha. Unless you don't play Runescape then it's probably not funny.

I know C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript, and GDScript. 

## ⚒️ Projects
Not the next communist society, contrary to what the emoji above may suggest. 

I'm not going to write about my projects here, because I already have them documented on [my website](https://kolin63.com).
